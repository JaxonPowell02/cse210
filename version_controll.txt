What is version control and why is it important?
Version control is basically being able to control the different versions of your 
project or code. For example using visual studio code and github. You can create
code or add to existing code and then you can upload what you have to the git hub servers.
After that you can continue to work on the code and if things go wrong, you have a history
of your code and you can go back and restore it. Being able to restore your code and see previous 
versions of your code is a big benefit of version control. A command that is used for git hub is 
git status, this command will tell you if you have changes that need to be added to the git hub server.
